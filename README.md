## Optimizing Content Strategy with Machine Learning: Social Media Engagement Prediction

This project explores how machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) can be used to predict social media engagement based on post content. By analyzing captions, hashtags, and other features, we aim to empower content creators and marketers with data-driven insights to optimize their strategies and maximize engagement.

### Project Goals

* Understand the key factors influencing social media engagement.
* Develop a model to predict post performance based on content features.
* Provide actionable recommendations for content strategy improvement.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project included features related to post reach, user interactions, captions, hashtags, and engagement metrics:

* Reach: Impressions and sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore, Other)
* User Interactions: Saves, Comments, Shares, Likes
* Post Content: Caption text and Hashtags
* Engagement Metrics: Engagement Rate, Conversion Rate, Conversion Rate (Visits), Save Rate, Hashtags Reach %

### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

* Text cleaning for captions and hashtags (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stop-word elimination)
* Transformation of textual data into numerical features using TF-IDF and CountVectorizer
* Feature extraction (key terms and engagement scores)
* Incorporation of additional numerical features (Conversion Rates, Save Rate, Hashtags Reach %)

### Model Development

* **Model Selection:** Random Forest Classifier (effective for diverse feature sets and handles both numerical and categorical data)
* **Feature Combination:** Textual features (TF-IDF vectors) and numerical features (engagement rates, conversion rates, etc.)
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV used to optimize Random Forest model hyperparameters

### Performance Evaluation

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 83.33% on the test dataset. However, performance varied across engagement levels:

* **High Engagement:** Excellent performance (Precision: 0.88, Recall: 0.78, F1-Score: 0.82)
* **Moderate Engagement:** Strong performance (Precision: 0.81, Recall: 0.93, F1-Score: 0.87)
* **Low Engagement:** Needs improvement (Precision: 0.00, Recall: 0.00, F1-Score: 0.00) - This may be due to data imbalance or insufficient representation of low engagement examples.

### Insights and Content Strategy

**Hashtag Analysis:**

* **High-Performing Hashtags:** 
    * #python (Engagement Score: 43.00)
    * #pythonprogramming (Engagement Score: 34.00)
    * #pythonprojects (Engagement Score: 27.00)
    * #pythoncode (Engagement Score: 23.00)
* **Low-Performing Hashtags:** 
    * #softskills (Engagement Score: 1.00)
    * #datasciencejobs (Engagement Score: 1.00)
    * #datasciencecourse (Engagement Score: 0.33)
    * #python3 & #sql (Engagement Score: 0.00) - Consider revising usage for better context/relevance.

**Caption Analysis:**

* **High Engagement Captions:** Frequently included terms like "data," "analysis," and "time," suggesting focus on insightful and timely information.
* **Low Engagement Captions:** Used terms like "education," "training," and "jobs," which may be less engaging or require a stronger impact in the caption.

### Recommendations

* **Focus on High-Performing Hashtags:** Include relevant hashtags like #python and #pythonprogramming to boost engagement.
* **Optimize Captions:** Use engaging terms related to data, analysis, and time to capture user interest.
* **Reevaluate Low-Performing Hashtags and Captions:** Consider revising or reducing their use based on audience preferences.

By implementing these recommendations, content creators can craft more engaging content and achieve better results on social media platforms.
