# Social-Media-Engagement-Prediction
This project set out with a clear objective: to uncover the secrets behind social media engagement by predicting how well posts perform based on their content features. Specifically, we focused on analyzing captions and hashtags — two crucial elements that can significantly impact user interaction.
We harnessed the power of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to dive deep into the data. Our goal was to identify which aspects of posts - such as the words used in captions or the hashtags employed - are associated with higher levels of engagement. By decoding these patterns, we aimed to provide actionable insights that can help in shaping content strategies to maximize engagement and achieve better results.
Through this project, we not only sought to understand what drives high engagement but also to empower content creators and marketers with data-driven recommendations. Whether you're a brand looking to enhance your social media presence or an influencer aiming to connect more effectively with your audience, the insights from this analysis can be a valuable asset in your content strategy.

## Data Overview
Our dataset included the following features:
Impressions: Reach of the post.
From Home, Hashtags, Explore, Other: Sources of reach.
Saves, Comments, Shares, Likes: User interactions.
Profile Visits, Follows: User actions leading to profile visits and follows.
Caption: The text of the post.
Hashtags: Tags used in the post.
Engagement Rate: Measure of overall engagement.
Conversion Rate: Rate at which posts lead to conversions.
Conversion Rate (Visits): Rate at which posts lead to visits.
Save Rate: Rate of saves.
Hashtags Reach %: Reach percentage from hashtags.

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Text Preprocessing:

We applied text cleaning techniques to the Caption and Hashtags columns, including lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stop-word elimination.
TF-IDF and CountVectorizer were used to transform textual data into numerical features for model training.

Feature Extraction:

We extracted key terms from the processed text to identify important features.
Engagement scores were calculated for hashtags and captions to evaluate their impact on engagement.

We also incorporated several numerical features into our analysis to provide a more comprehensive view of post performance:
Conversion Rate: This metric measures the rate at which posts lead to desired actions, such as purchases or sign-ups. A higher conversion rate indicates that posts are effectively driving user actions.
Conversion Rate (Visits): This specifically measures the rate at which posts result in visits to a profile or website. It helps us understand how well posts are generating traffic.
Save Rate: This metric reflects how often posts are saved by users, which can indicate the content's perceived value and relevance.
Hashtags Reach %: This feature measures the percentage of reach that comes from hashtags, highlighting how effective hashtags are in extending the post's visibility.

Model Development
Feature Combination:
To create a robust predictive model for social media engagement, we combined several feature types into a comprehensive dataset:
Textual Features: We utilized TF-IDF vectors derived from captions and hashtags. These vectors transformed the textual data into numerical form, enabling us to capture the significance of individual terms in predicting engagement.
Numerical Features: We included additional metrics such as engagement rates, conversion rates, save rates, and hashtag reach percentages. These numerical features provided a broader perspective on post performance by quantifying user interactions and content effectiveness.

Model Selection:
For model development, we chose the Random Forest Classifier due to its strong performance in handling diverse feature sets and its ability to manage both numerical and categorical data effectively. To ensure optimal performance, we employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. This approach allowed us to systematically explore various parameter combinations and identify the best settings for the Random Forest model.
Performance Evaluation:
The Random Forest model achieved an impressive accuracy of 83.33% on the test dataset. The detailed performance metrics are as follows:
High Engagement:
Precision: 0.88
Recall: 0.78
F1-Score: 0.82
The model performed excellently in predicting high engagement posts, showing high precision and a solid recall rate.
Low Engagement:
Precision: 0.00
Recall: 0.00
F1-Score: 0.00
The model struggled with predicting low engagement posts, resulting in zero precision and recall. This issue may be attributed to an imbalance in the dataset or insufficient representation of low engagement examples.
Moderate Engagement:
Precision: 0.81
Recall: 0.93
F1-Score: 0.87
The model performed well for moderate engagement posts, demonstrating high recall and a strong F1-score, indicating effective identification of moderate engagement cases.

The Random Forest model demonstrated strong performance for high and moderate engagement predictions, though improvements are needed to better handle low engagement cases.
Insights and Content Strategy
Hashtags Analysis:
The analysis of hashtags revealed significant insights into their impact on social media engagement:
High-Performing Hashtags:
#python: With an engagement score of 43.00, this hashtag consistently drove high engagement, suggesting a strong association with popular and relevant content within the Python programming community.
#pythonprogramming: Scoring 34.00, this hashtag also performed exceptionally well, highlighting its effectiveness in reaching an audience interested in Python programming topics.
#pythonprojects: With an engagement score of 27.00, this hashtag was effective in attracting engagement, likely due to its appeal to users looking for project ideas and programming challenges.
#pythoncode: An engagement score of 23.00 indicates that this hashtag is useful for engaging users interested in code-related discussions and tips.
Low-Performing Hashtags:
#softskills: This hashtag had an engagement score of just 1.00, indicating that it is less effective in driving high engagement compared to more specific programming-related hashtags.
#datasciencejobs: With a score of 1.00, this hashtag also performed poorly, suggesting that job-related tags might not be as engaging for the audience compared to content-focused hashtags.
#datasciencecourse: Scoring 0.33, this hashtag was less effective in driving engagement, potentially due to the specific nature of the content it represents.
#python3 and #sql: Both hashtags had engagement scores of 0.00, indicating that they did not perform well in terms of driving engagement. This may suggest a need for more context or relevance in their usage.

Captions Analysis:
Examining the captions used in high and low engagement posts provided further insights:
High Engagement Captions:
Captions frequently included terms like "data," "analysis," and "time," with high engagement scores. These words were associated with posts that resonated well with the audience, likely because they were relevant and engaging in the context of data science and analysis.
The presence of these terms suggests that captions focusing on insightful data analysis or timely information tend to perform better, indicating that users value content that provides clear and actionable insights.
Low Engagement Captions:
Captions with terms such as "education," "training," and "jobs" had lower engagement scores. This may indicate that these topics are less engaging to the audience or that the captions lacked the impact necessary to capture attention.
The lower performance of these terms suggests that posts focusing on educational content or job-related information might need to be crafted differently or supplemented with more engaging elements to improve their effectiveness.

Next Steps and GitHub Repository
Based on the analysis, here are a few recommendations for content strategy:
Focus on High-Performing Hashtags: Incorporate hashtags like #python, #pythonprogramming, and #pythonprojects into your posts to boost engagement.
Optimize Captions: Use engaging and relevant terms related to data, analysis, and time to increase the likelihood of higher engagement.
Reevaluate Low-Performing Hashtags and Captions: Consider revising or reducing the use of hashtags and terms that have shown low engagement to better align with audience interests.

By applying these findings, content creators and marketers can tailor their strategies to drive better performance and higher user interaction. This project not only demonstrates the practical application of data science in social media but also provides a foundation for ongoing optimization and strategic enhancement.
